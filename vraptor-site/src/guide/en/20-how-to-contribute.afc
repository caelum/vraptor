VRaptor is a MVC Web Framework focused in simplicity and easy of use. When you implement something, take care to follow the best practices of Object Orientation and low coupling, use of composition instead of inheritance, convention over configuration and a well structured code. Make sure you also write the Javadocs classes and unit tests.

Contributions like security, paging, multitenant, and others are welcome through plugins and contributions to vraptor-contrib [4], or extensions to vraptor-scaffold [5].


[section Setting up the environment]

All VRaptor's modules have the %%classpath-example%% and %%project-example%% files, making it easy to import the project to Eclipse. In this case, rename the files to %%.classpath%% and %%.project%% respectively.

If you use another IDE, just make the directories %%src/main/java%%, %%src/test/java%%, %%src/test/resources%% and %%src/main/resources%% as source folders. The libraries used stays in %%lib%% directory.
