[chapter Google App Engine]

[section Starting a new project]

Due to security restrictions on Google App Engine's sandbox,
some of VRaptor3's components must be replaced, and a different
selection of dependencies must be used. A version of the
blank project featuring these modifications is available at
our download page.

[section Limitations]

A relevant detais is that the dependency injection does not work
when redirecting from one logic to another; the controller is
instantiated by filling with %%null%% all of its arguments. This
said, one should avoid call like:

[java]
	result.use(Results.logic()).redirectTo(SomeController.class).someMethod();
	validator.onErrorUse(Results.logic()).of(SomeController.class).someMethod();
[/java]

using, instead, %%Results.page()%%. An alternative would be to
prepare your controllers to expect %%null%% as construction
arguments.


[section Troubleshooting]

App Engine's execution environment nor does enable support
for Expression Language by default, nor supports the
%%<jsp-config/jsp-proprerty-group/el-ignored>%% tag. In this
situation, to enable the EL support, it's required to add
the following line to your JSP files:

%%<%@ page isELIgnored="false" %>%%

For tag files, use:

%%<%@ tag isELIgnored="false" %>%%

[section JPA 2] 

VRaptor supports JPA versions 1 and 2, but Google App Engine only supports JPA 1. 
Therefore you should avoid copying the jpa-api-2.0.jar file to your project.
