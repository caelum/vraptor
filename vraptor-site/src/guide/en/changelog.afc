[chapter ChangeLog]

[section 3.0.1 (to be released))]
[list]
* paranamer upgraded to version 1.5 (Update your jar!)
* jars split in optional and mandatory on vraptor-core
* dependencies are now explained on vraptor-core/libs/mandatory/dependencies.txt and
  vraptor-core/libs/optional/dependencies.txt
* you can set now your application character encoding on web.xml through the context-param
	br.com.caelum.vraptor.encoding
* new view: Referer view:
  result.use(Results.referer()).redirect();
* Flash scope:
  [java]
  result.include("aKey", anObject);
  result.use(logic()).redirectTo(AController.class).aMethod();
  [/java]
  objects included on Result will survive until next request when a redirect happens.
* @Path annotation supports multiple values (String -> String[])
* Result.include returns this to enable a fluent interface (result.include(...).include(...))
* Better exception message when there is no such http method as requested  
* FileDownload registers content-length
* Solving issue 117: exposing null when null returned (was exposing "ok")
* Solving issue 109: if you have a file %%/path/index.jsp%%, you can access it now through
	%%/path/%%, unless you have a controller that handles this URI.
[/list]

[section 3.0.0-rc-1]
[list]
* example application: mydvds
* new way to add options components into VRaptor:
[java]
public class CustomProvider extends SpringProvider {
	
	@Override
	protected void registerCustomComponents(ComponentRegistry registry) {
		registry.registry(OptionComponent.class, OptionComponent.class);
	}
}
[/java]

[/list]
[section 3.0.0-beta-5]
[list]
* New way to do validations:
  [java]
  	public void visualiza(Client client) {
  		validator.checking(new Validations() {{
  			that(client.getId() != null, "id", "id.should.be.filled");
  		}});
  		validator.onErrorUse(page()).of(ClientsController.class).list();
  		
  		//continua o metodo
  	}
  [/java]
* UploadedFile.getFile() now returns InputStream.
* EntityManagerCreator and EntityManagerFactoryCreator
* bugfixes

[/list]
[section 3.0.0-beta-4]
[list]
* New result: result.use(page()).of(MyController.class).myLogic() renders the default view
	(/WEB-INF/jsp/meu/myLogica.jsp) without execting the logic.
*	Mock classes for testing: MockResult e MockValidator, to make easier to unit test your logics.
	They ignores the fluent interface calls and keep the parameters included under the result and
	the validation errors.
*	The URIs passed to result.use(page()).forward(uri) and result.use(page()).redirect(uri)
	can't be logic URIs. Use forwards or redirects from result.use(logic()) instead.
*	Parameters passed to URI's now accepts pattern-matching:
	[list]
	* Automatic: if we have the URI /clients/{client.id} and client.id is a Long, the {client.id} parameter 
		will only match numbers, so, the URI /clients/42 matches, but the /clients/random doesn't matches.
		This works for all numeric types, booleans and enums. VRaptor will restrict the possible values.
	* Manual: in your CustomRoutes you can do:
		routeFor("/clients/{client.id}").withParameter("client.id").matching("\\d{1,4}")
  			.is(ClienteController.class).mostra(null);
  	which means you can restrict values for the parameters you want by regexes at the matching method.
  [/list]
* Converters for joda-times's LocalDate and LocalTime comes by default.
* When Spring is the IoC provider, VRaptor tries to find your application's spring to use as
	a father container. This search is made by one of the following two ways:
	[list]
	* WebApplicationContextUtils.getWebApplicationContext(servletContext), when you have Spring's listeners
	configured.
	* applicationContext.xml inside the classpath
	[/list]
	If it's not enough, you can implements the SpringLocator interface and enable the Spring's ApplicationContext
	used by your application. 
*	Utils:
	[list]
	* SessionCreator and SessionFactoryCreator to create Hibernate's Session and SessionFactory 
	to your registered components.
	* EncodingInterceptor, to change you default encoding.
	[/list]
* several bugfixes and docs improvements.
[/list]
[section 3.0.0-beta-3]
[list]
* Spring becomes the default IoC provider
* the applicationContext.xml under the classpath is used as Spring initial configuration, if it exists.
* improved docs at http://vraptor.caelum.com.br/documentacao

[/list]
