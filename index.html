        <p>VRaptor 3 focuses in simplicity and, therefore, all of its functionalities have as main goal solve the developer's problem in the less intrusive way.</p>

<p>Either CRUD operations or more complex functionalities such as download, upload, results in different formats (xml, json, xhtml etc), everything is done through VRaptor3's simple and easy-to-understand functionalities. You don't have to deal directly with HttpServletRequest, Responses or any javax.servlet API, although you still have the control of all Web operations.</p>

<h3>Starting up</h3>

<p>You can start your project based on vraptor-blank-project, available on <a href="http://vraptor.caelum.com.br/download.jsp">http://vraptor.caelum.com.br/download.jsp</a> . It contains all required jar dependencies, and the minimal web.xml configuration for working with VRaptor.</p>

<p>The vraptor-blank-project project is configured to work with Eclipse. But if you use Netbeans IDE you can import project using the guide avaliable on <a href="http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/import-eclipse.html">http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/import-eclipse.html</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to use Maven, you can add VRaptor's Maven artifact on your pom.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;br.com.caelum&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;vraptor&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.2.0&lt;/version&gt;&lt;!--or the latest version--&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>A simple controller</h3>

<p>Having VRaptor properly configured on your web.xml, you can create your controllers for dealing with web requests and start building your system. A simple controller would be:</p>

<pre><code>/*
* You should annotate your controller with @Resource, so all of its public methods will
* be ready to deal with web requests.
*/
@Resource
public class ClientsController {

    private ClientDao dao;

    /*
     * You can get your class dependencies through constructor, and VRaptor will be in charge
     * of creating or locating these dependencies and manage them to create your controller.
     * If you want that VRaptor3 manages creation of ClientDao, you should annotate it with
     * @Component
     */
    public ClientsController(ClientDao dao) {
        this.dao = dao;    
    }

    /*
     * All public methods from your controller will be reachable through web.
     * For example, form method can be accessed by URI /clients/form,
     * and will render the view /WEB-INF/jsp/clients/form.jsp
     */
    public void form() {
        // code that loads data for checkboxes, selects, etc
    }

    /*
     * You can receive parameters on your method, and VRaptor will set your parameters
     * fields with request parameters. If the request have:
     * custom.name=Lucas
     * custom.address=Vergueiro Street
     * VRaptor will set the fields name and address of Client custom with values
     * "Lucas" and "Vergueiro Street", using the fields setters.
     * URI: /clients/add
     * view: /WEB-INF/jsp/clients/add.jsp
     */
    public void add(Client custom) {
        dao.save(custom);
    }

    /*
     * VRaptor will export your method return value to the view. In this case,
     * since your method return type is List&lt;Clients&gt;, then you can access the
     * returned value on your jsp with the variable ${clientList}
     * URI: /clients/list
     * view: /WEB-INF/jsp/clients/list.jsp
     */
    public List&lt;Client&gt; list() {
        return dao.listAll():
    }

    /*
     * If the return type is a simple type, the name of exported variable will be
     * the class name with the first letter in lower case. Since this method return
     * type is Client, the variable will be ${client}.
     * A request parameter would be something like id=5, and then VRaptor is able
     * to get this value, convert it to Long, and pass it as parameter to your method.
     * URI: /clients/view
     * view: /WEB-INF/jsp/clients/view.jsp
     */
    public Client view(Long id) {
        return dao.load(id);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this class is independent of javax.servlet API. The code is also very simple and can be unit tested easily. VRaptor will make associations with these URIs by default:</p>

<pre><code>/client/form   invokes form()
/client/add    invokes add(client) populating the client with request parameters
/clients/list  invokes list() and returns ${clientList} to JSP
/clients/view?id=3  invokes view(3l) and returns ${client} to JSP
</code></pre>

<p>We'll see later how easy it is to change the URI /clients/view?id=3 to the more elegant /clients/view/3.
ClientDao will also be injected by VRaptor, as we'll see. You can see now the Ten minutes guide:
