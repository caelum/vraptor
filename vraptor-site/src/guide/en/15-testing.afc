[chapter Testing components and controllers]

VRaptor3 manages your class dependencies, so there is no need to worry about
instantiating your components and controllers, you can just receive your dependencies
on the constructor and VRaptor3 will locate them and instantiate your class.

You can take advantage of dependency injection when testing your classes:
you can instantiate your class with fake implementations and unit test the class.

Nevertheless, there are two VRaptor3 components that are dependencies of most of your 
controllers: %%Result%% and %%Validator%%. Their fluent interfaces makes it difficult to
create fake implementations or mocks. Therefore there are fake implementations for
these components on VRaptor3: %%MockResult%% e %%MockValidator%%.

[section MockResult]

MockResult ignores all redirects, and stores the included objects, so you can inspect
them and make assertions.

This snippet shows you how you can use MockResult:

[java]
MockResult result = new MockResult();
ClientController controller = new ClientController(..., result);
controller.list(); // will call result.include("clients", something);
List<Client> clients = result.included("clients"); // the cast is implicit
Assert.assertNotNull(clients);
// more assertions
[/java]

Any calls to result.use(...) will be ignored.

[section MockValidator]

MockValidator will store generated errors, so if there is any error when 
validator.onErrorUse is called, a ValidationError will be thrown. Therefore
you can inspect the added errors, or simply check if there is any error.

[java]
@Test(expected=ValidationException.class)
public void testThatAValidationErrorOccurs() {
	ClientController controller = new ClientController(..., new MockValidator());
	controller.add(new Client());
}
[/java]
ou
[java]
@Test
public void testThatAValidationErrorOccurs() {
	ClientController controller = new ClientController(..., new MockValidator());
	try {
		controller.add(new Cliente());
		Assert.fail();
	} catch (ValidationException e) {
		List<Message> errors = e.getErrors();
		//assertions on errors
	}
}
[/java]
